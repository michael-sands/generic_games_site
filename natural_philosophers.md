This is a non-violent, creative game in which you will imagine what an expedition of natural philosophers discover in an entirely new world. 

You'll fill up a notebook with observations, inspired by a range of random tables, to build the world you explore.

You'll need this PDF, some pens and notebooks, and a few regular six sided dice. There's no game master role, everyone takes an equal part in playing.
