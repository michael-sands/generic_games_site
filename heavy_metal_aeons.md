Heavy metal inspired science-fantasy adventures.

Currently in early access. You can [get into the early access at itch.io](https://genericgames.itch.io/heavy-metal-aeons) or [drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/350506/Heavy-Metal-Aeons). The game is complete and ready to play, but the challenge levels likely still need some tweaks.

Illustrated by Juan Ochoa. Here's the Astronaut, trying to work out what filthy planet he's washed up on.
