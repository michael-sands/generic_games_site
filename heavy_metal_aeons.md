Heavy metal inspired science-fantasy adventures.

Currently in development, you can [get the current playtest document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5pV27F3R0veOFRZVm1MX21EamM) if you would
like to read it and maybe try it out. There's also a [play reference and handouts document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5pV27F3R0veQjU0UkI2dUdya28).
The two playtest documents may not be completely in step - make sure you check
the dates in them, and if there's a disagreement use the newest.

There's also a [G+ community to discuss the game](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/107067663546804138073).

Character archetypes have been illustrated by Juan Ochoa. Here's the Astronaut,
trying to work out what filthy planet he's washed up on.

## The Official Playlist

Here's a playlist for the game. It includes all the hero and scenario theme
songs as well as anything else I like that fits the game:
