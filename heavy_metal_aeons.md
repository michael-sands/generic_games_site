Heavy metal inspired science-fantasy adventures.

Currently in early access. You can [get into the early access at itch.io](https://genericgames.itch.io/heavy-metal-aeons) or [drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/350506/Heavy-Metal-Aeons). The game is complete and ready to play, but the challenge levels likely still need some tweaks.

Character archetypes have been illustrated by Juan Ochoa. Here's the Astronaut,
trying to work out what filthy planet he's washed up on.

## The Official Playlist

Here's a playlist for the game. It includes all the hero and scenario theme
songs as well as anything else I like that fits the game:
