# Generic Games Third Party Works Policy

Last updated: 27 August 2019.

1. **General Policy**
   2. You are allowed to create original works compatible with my texts, for commercial or non-commercial purposes.
   3. This only applies to text written by me (Michael Sands), not any parts of my games created by other people (which includes other authors, artists, layouts).
   4. This does not cover derivative works or translations of a whole text. If that's what you'd like to do, please get in touch with me.
   5. A "derivative work" is any work that uses large amounts of my game text either reproduced directly or with only small changes. (For example, if you want to create a roleplaying game "_Alpaca of the Week_" in which the group solves a series of Alpaca-based mysteries, based on _Monster of the Week_, which involves reproducing chunks of the _Monster of the Week_ text without changes). 
1. **Reproducing Text**
   1. You are welcome to quote or use snippets of text that are needed for rules purposes (for example, reproducing the text of a threat type and description in a _Monster of the Week_ mystery). 
   1. If you wish to quote a larger piece of text (for example, reproducing some paragraphs of advice for a derivative game) that may or may not be acceptable. Please ask permission directly.
2. **Attribution**
   2. For compatible works, please include a note like: "For use with with Monster of the Week by Michael Sands."
   2. For derivative works, please include a note like: "Derived from Monster of the Week by Michael Sands"
3. **Approved Works**
   4. For _Monster of the Week_ compatible or derived works, I am happy to give you an official "Approved for use with _Monster of the Week_" logo to include. If you would like to apply, send me an email. I'll need to look over the work and confirm that I'm happy to be associated with it, before you may use the logo. Note: approval will be based on a base level of professional presentation consistent with your plans for the work and lack of problematic content.

# FAQ
* Here's where to email me with questions about licensing or this policy: <mike@genericgames.co.nz>.
* If you want to create a mystery or new hunter playbook for _Monster of the Week_, go ahead! Just include the attribution message (section 3.1) and make sure you follow the policy for reproducing text (section 2).
* For personal use, do what you like. The policy is for when you want to share your work beyond your own game group.
