<img src="/images/three_dooms_logo.png" alt="Three skulls logo" width="150" align="right">Tell the story of a stone age community - one of the first towns ever built.

The omens foretell three great dooms are coming. Can the people of your town
resist them?

How will the story of your town play out? Will you be remembered in legend, or
only known when uncovered by archaeologists in millennia to come?

_Three Dooms_ is a card-driven game in which you will create the history of
your town, trace the lineages of townsfolk, draw a map of your town's region,
and play notable townsfolk as they deal with significant events.

Each of you will take turns as the Oracle. When you are the Oracle, you draw and
interpret the next event card, then guide the others to resolve it, and finally
guide the passage of time until the next event, when the next person takes the
Oracle's mantle.
