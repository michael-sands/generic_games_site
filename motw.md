*There are monsters out there.*

Most people don't believe in them, but they're real. Mostly, when someone finds out that monsters are real, that's just before they die.

But some people are mean enough, smart enough, crazy enough, or hurt enough, that they live. And some of those people go and hunt down more.

That's who you are â€“ someone who decided to go on a crusade against the evil critters that are scurrying around out there.

It could be that you make a stand and defend your hometown from everything evil that comes there.

It could be you take to the road and go find them.

It could be you have magic powers that help out.

It could be that your name came up in prophecies thousands of years ago.

The one sure thing is you aren't gonna go back to your old, safe life.

FAQ
---

* Q: Do I need a copy of *Apocalypse World* to play *Monster of the Week*?

  A: No, *Monster of the Week* is a stand-alone game. The mechanics are based on *Apocalypse World*, but you won't need a copy.

* Q: Where can I get a copy of the handouts?

  A: Hit "Files" on the menu.
  

Errata (revised edition)
----------------------

* Countdowns: "Dusk" should come after "Sunset" (by definition, which I didn't realise back then). Switch these two elements of your countdowns, so they go *Day*, *Shadows*, *Sunset*, *Dusk*, *Nightfall*, *Midnight*.
* Advanced Improvements: All hunters should have a single "Get back one used Luck mark" as one of their advanced improvements. The Mundane is unchanged, with two of these in their advanced list.
* Crooked weapons (page 39): The submachinegun and assault rifle should have "area" tags, not "auto."

Errata (first edition)
----------------------

* page 61, Hunter Reference Sheet: The text for manipulate someone is not consistent between the discussion in the hunter and keeper sections and the hunter reference sheet. The canonical text change is for the 10+ result for bystanders, which should read: "If you get 10+, then they'll do it for the reason you gave them." There's an updated hunter reference sheet in the files section here.
