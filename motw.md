![Monster of the Week](../images/MOTW-Page-Header.jpg)

*There are monsters out there.*

Most people don't believe in them, but they're real. Mostly, when someone finds out that monsters are real, that's just before they die.

But some people are mean enough, smart enough, crazy enough, or hurt enough, that they live. And some of those people go and hunt down more.

That's who you are â€“ someone who decided to go on a crusade against the evil critters that are scurrying around out there.

It could be that you make a stand and defend your hometown from everything evil that comes there.

It could be you take to the road and go find them.

It could be you have magic powers that help out.

It could be that your name came up in prophecies thousands of years ago.

The one sure thing is you aren't gonna go back to your old, safe life.

FAQ
---

* Q: Do I need a copy of *Apocalypse World* to play *Monster of the Week*?

  A: No, *Monster of the Week* is a stand-alone game. The mechanics are based on *Apocalypse World*, but you won't need a copy.

* Q: Where can I get a copy of the handouts?

  A: Click "Files" on the menu to the left.

* Q: I bought the Lulu edition of the game and would like the PDF edition as well. Can I get it?

  A: Yes, send me an email with your Lulu order number and I'll send you the download links.

* Q: Can I get a copy of the handouts in my own language?

  A: If that language is French, then you can. Nicolas Ronvel has translated them for you, and you can find them at his blog.

* Q: There are more hunter playbooks?

  A: Yes, there's a bunch! You can get them:

  * most of them are available for pay-what-you-want on drivethrurpg.
  * the Luchador (by Reid San Filippo), went out with orders from the first print run. This is a monster-fighting lucha libre wrestler, in the style of El Santo. It's available (with a few others by Reid) at nerdwerd's playbook repository.
  * the Action Scientist, is available if you run (or play) a *Monster of the Week* game at a convention. It's inspired by Atomic Robo, and will add some science-powered mayhem to your mystery. Drop me a line, if you have and I'll get the PDF to you.


Errata (first edition)
----------------------

* p61, Hunter Reference Sheet: The text for manipulate someone is not consistent between the discussion in the hunter and keeper sections and the hunter reference sheet. The canonical text change is for the 10+ result for bystanders, which should read: "If you get 10+, then they'll do it for the reason you gave them." There's an updated hunter reference sheet in the files section here.
