We want your mysteries! A not-so-secret cabal are going to put together a collection of _Monster of the Week_ mysteries, and we need writers!

It will be a profit share gig, so each piece contributed will earn you a share of ongoing sales.

We’re interested in short (less than 1000 words), creative mysteries that have a cool concept and are easily adaptable to the users’ individual games.

I’ll be including my expanded weirdness rules for games that are more _Fringe_ and _X-Files_ than _Supernatural_ and _Buffy_, as well, so mysteries that use those would also be appreciated. [Get the draft here](http://www.genericgames.co.nz/files/MotW_more_weirdness.pdf) if you haven’t seen them.

We would also be interested in (in order of desirability) play advice, art, custom moves and other rules variants, and new hunter classes.

If you have ideas for other material, please write up one short sample mystery or other material (up to 500 words) and email it to me at <michael.sands@genericgames.co.nz> by the 18th of December 2016.
