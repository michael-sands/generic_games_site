Welcome to #kiwiRPG week!

Ther's going to be loads happening focused on showing the RPG stuff happening here in Aotearoa New Zealand. Check out [kiwirpg.com](https://www.kiwirpg.com/) for all the details.

Right now, the big news is our kiwiRPG game bundles. These both include a range of games from different designers, plus discounts for the week. They're great deals too. 
There's a kiwiRPG [drivethuRPG bundle](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/390982/KiwiRPG-Week-2022-BUNDLE) and an [itch.io bundle](https://itch.io/b/1356/kiwirpg-week-bundle-2022). There's a different set of folks on each service, so the game selections are different too.

From Generic Games, there's a mini-RPG scheduled for release tomorrow and an announcement about Monster of the Week coming on Wednesday. 

Check the [kiwiRPG site for more events](https://www.kiwirpg.com/info/) over the week.
