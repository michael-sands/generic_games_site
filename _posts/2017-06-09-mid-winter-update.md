Here's what's happening in the **Generic Games** world right now:
* I'm in the middle of editing mysteries for the _Monster of the Week_ mystery
  collection. It's taking longer than I hoped but my priority is quality.
* The [_Three Dooms_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/199119/Three-Dooms) extra advice document is almost done, and that will be
  freely available when it's complete.
* Next up will be a new playtest draft of _Heavy Metal Ã†ons_ and then final text
  editing and polishing to work towards a kickstarter campaign.
* On the horizon is a playtest draft for my naval adventure game _Devil & the Deep_,
  which I've been working towards for 20 years now.

Also of interest, _Three Dooms_ got a mention in [a Radio NZ interview, about the state of
tabletop games these days](http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/nights/audio/201846857/nights-culture-tabletop-games). It's covers the educational _Game of Awesome_ that Morgan was involved in creating, plus _Gloom_ and
_Route Clearance_ (a winner of the [200-word RPG contest](https://200wordrpg.github.io/) by another Wellington
designer, Andy Millar).
