Hello, I decided it was time for an update about the state of Generic Games (that is, me).

I've recently had the opportunity to devote a lot more time to writing games and less to a day job, which is quite exciting. I've been getting a lot done and hope to have more releases for you this year. 

Here's what I'm working on now. Hopefully some of this will be of interest to some of you.

1. _XG-ULTRA_ is a game about a group of bold explorers jumping through portals to other planets and dealing with the problems they find there. It's a Forged in the Dark game, based mostly off _Band of Blades_. I've been playtesting this through the lockdown here in New Zealand, and it's been going great (except that I had to learn a lot about playtesting online to get it done).
2. _This Strange Old House_ and _Shared Inheritance_ are _Monster of the Week_ add-ons. The first is a setting, where the hunters inherit a spooky house and must uncover its secrets and deal with the evil inside it. The second is a team playbook, like a _Blades in the Dark_ crew sheet, for a hunter team drawn together by a legacy. These are intended to go together, but can also be used separately.
3. Revisions for the _Monster of the Week Reinforcements_ playbooks, to update the layout and bring them in line with my current approach to hunter archetypes.
4. A solo journalling game, in which you are a lone wanderer on a quest through a far future land. Still writing this one up.
5. A big update for the early access version of [The Natural Philosophers](https://genericgames.itch.io/the-natural-philosophers), after another playtest and the associated feedback. 

These are on the backburner:
6. _Heavy Metal Æons_, the game of heavy metal science fantasy adventures. I need to write up and playtest a major rules change before this can move ahead.
7. _Devil & the Deep_, the game of character-focused naval adventure. I'm planning to release a quickstart/beta pack for this.
8. A new hunter archetype for _Monster of the Week_, tentatively named the Spooktacular. It's a hunter with a background in a supernatural travelling show.
9. A revision and update for [Too Many Draculas](https://genericgames.itch.io/the-meddling-kids-in-too-many-draculas).

I expect to get back onto _Devil & the Deep_ once the first draft of _XG-ULTRA_ is done, and _Heavy Metal Æons_ after that. The smaller projects will get done when I have gaps in the bigger ones.
