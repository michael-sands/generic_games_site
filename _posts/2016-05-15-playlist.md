I've started putting together a [_Heavy Metal Æons_ playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/mad_jack_mcmad/playlist/5HGygyYe6kNBQXthqTjxsh).
Have a listen if you need to get into the right headspace to play or prepare.

It currently contains the song references from all the archetypes, plus the
scenario theme songs. I'll continue adding more music, anything that fits the
game's style that I come across.
