The Portuguese translation of _Monster of the Week_,
[_Monstro da Semana_](https://monstrodasemana.wordpress.com/), is now available!

Luis Borges has been working very hard on the translation, and you can see in
[this unboxing of the finished print book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=289bKH6TlYE)
that it's paid off - it's a lovely looking book.
