As this is something that's come up a few times recently, I've decided to codify my policy on third party works for use with my games (which currently really just means _Monster of the Week_).

[Find the policy here](/third_party_policy).

This is still a work in progress, so there may be some changes still. I expect any changes will only be small clarifications.
