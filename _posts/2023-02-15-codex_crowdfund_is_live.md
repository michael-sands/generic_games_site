You can now order the _Codex of Worlds_! 

Check out the [campaign on backerkit](https://www.backerkit.com/c/evil-hat/codex-of-worlds)!

The new stuff:
* Team playbooks to give each group a particular style and shared improvements.
* This Strange Old House setting: the hunters get possession of a house full of dangerous secrets.
* Gothic Century setting: drop your game into a gothic-infused nineteenth century.
* Dreaming With The Gods setting: a surreal Renaissance world where alchemy and dream magic have brought a wondrous (and terrible) new age.
* Monster Marches: a medieval fantasy setting where monster hunters are outcasts, and the spirits of nature and needs of the people come into conflict.
* Bone Spear: a stone age setting where the hunters protect their community from monsters, but with a focus on solving the problem that created the monster rather than just destroying them.
* Advice on building your own alternate settings.
* Some optional rules modules and new advice for play.

It's already funded, so now we're into stretch goals. We have some cool extras planned if the campaign goes well.
