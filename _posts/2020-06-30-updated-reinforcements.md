I've completed the bulk of the work on updating the extra hunter playbooks, and the Monster of the Week Reinforcements bundle has been updated with the new versions. They're all now in the new style layout, and I've gone through and cleaned up the text and fixed some errata too. 
The Hard Case has been completely redone and now needs to build up their Fire pool through suffering, after which they can spend it for a variety of effects.

If you already purchased the [bundle on drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/130278/Monster-of-the-Week-Reinforcements), you can download the new playbooks from there. I've also added [the bundle to my itch page](https://genericgames.itch.io/monster-of-the-week-reinforcements).

The Summoned still needs a little more work, so it's not updated yet. 

And the Spooktacular will be coming soon, as a separate download (I'm just waiting on art for that one).

Edit to add: There's also a [revised version of the Constructed](https://genericgames.co.nz/files/constructed_2020.pdf) on the files page, which thanks to Reid's generosity will remain a free download.
