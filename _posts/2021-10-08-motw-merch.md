Get yourself some [_Monster of the Week_ shirts–or other stuff–on my new Redbubble store](https://www.redbubble.com/people/genericgames/shop).

Juan Ochoa drew this first design, "Behind you!" 

I've provided some options for use on light or dark backgrounds and with or without text. (Personally I tend to like less text on my clothing.)

If it's successful, I'll commission more designs to add to the range.
