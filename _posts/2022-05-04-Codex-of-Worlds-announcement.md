It's time for some new _Monster of the Week_ stuff! [#kiwiRPG week](https://www.kiwirpg.com/info/) seemed like a great occasion to announce: 

The _Codex of Worlds_ is coming soon.

The _Codex_ includes new content to bring different styles and settings to your _Monster of the Week_ games. It's written by Michael Sands and Marek Golonka, and being developed in partnership with Evil Hat Productions.

Inside you'll find:
* Team playbooks that give your hunter team a specific style, assets, team moves, and enemies. 
* Setting frameworks that provide a whole different starting point to your game. These range from those that only alter the contemporary setting a little to whole new worlds with totally new monsters and problems.
* New rules to support the new material, which can be applied to any _Monster of the Week_ game if you want to spice things up.

We're still in the middle of development, so there's no release date yet and plenty more work to do. "Coming soon" is as specific as we can be.

But soon you'll have the chance to open the _Codex of Worlds_.

Get ready for new monsters, and new realms.

Good hunting!
