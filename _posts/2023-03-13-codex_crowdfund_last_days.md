The [_Codex of Worlds_ crowdfund](https://www.backerkit.com/c/evil-hat/codex-of-worlds) has just two days left to go! If you were thinking of backing, now's the time to do it. We've got a huge amount of extra material coming from the stretch goals, with several very cool guest authors involved.

The new [hardcover _Monster of the Week_ rulebook](https://evilhat.com/product/monster-of-the-week/) is also available to order, if you are new to the game or need to replace a battered softcover.

I've been doing a bit of publicity too, so check out these if you'd like to know a bit more about what's in the new books:

* [I talked to Dicebreaker about MotW specifically and games generally](https://www.dicebreaker.com/series/monster-of-the-week/interview/monster-of-the-week-rpg-designer-michael-sands).
* I [streamed a mystery](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1756794743) to try out the Monster Revelations team playbook, one of the _Codex_ stretch goals. Thanks to Sero for inviting me!
* I [played some games in the Strange Old House setting](https://thecritshowpodcast.com/lets-play/codex-of-worlds/) from the _Codex_ with some guests on the Critshow.

Now it's time for me to get back to the last checks on the new book, and writing up all my stretch goal material that's been unlocked.
