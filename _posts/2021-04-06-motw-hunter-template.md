By popular request, here are some templates for those of you making your own hunter playbooks who would like to have them match the style of the official ones. They have some placeholder text and a few tips to get you started as well.

I've created templates for [Adobe InDesign](/files/MotW_hunter_playbook_template.indd), in [Adobe IDML format](/files/MotW_hunter_playbook_template.idml), or for [Affinity Publisher](/files/MotW_hunter_playbook_template.afpub).

You'll need to have three fonts: 3rd Man by Bumbayo Font Fabrik, Warnock Pro, and the Evil Hat Fate Core Glyphs. 

Thanks to Fred Hicks at Evil Hat Productions for both creating the original playbooks (they were quite challenging!) and letting me share these with you all.
