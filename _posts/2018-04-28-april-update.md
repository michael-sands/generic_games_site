This is your periodic update on what's going on with Generic Games.

1. The _Monster of the Week_ mystery collection is almost done. The text is 99% ready, next steps are to get it into layout and production after that final 1% is complete. It's looking really great, with a huge, varied, pile of mysteries and some great play advice. I'll have more news about this very soon.
2. I've dug up an old pair of _Monster of the Week_ mysteries that I had mostly got ready for release and I'm finishing those up for a PDF release by themselves. It will be a _Zombiefest Double Feature_. Long time fans will recognise _Zombiefest_ from the original crowdfunding campaign extras, but I'm expanding it a bit and adding _Zombiefest 2_.
3. _Heavy Metal Ã†ons_ work continues. I'm building the next full draft, looking at some more of my own playtesting soon, then release of that playtest draft, then onto the full text.
4. _Devil & the Deep_ is next. The core rules are done, but it needs a long playtest game to check the advancement rules and tweak the sea battles and other hazards more fully.
5. If you're in/near Wellington, I'll be at [Confusion](http://confusion.rpg.net.nz/) on Saturday 4 August, running my games. Come along!

Now, back to finishing up the mystery collection, preparing to move house, and writing my _The One Ring_ plan for Monday. Just a little busy.
