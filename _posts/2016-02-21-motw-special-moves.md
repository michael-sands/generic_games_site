Prompted by a thread on rpg.net, I've put together a list of special moves for
all the different hunters. These are moves that happen when you spend a Luck -
a few already have these written in, but I didn't think of adding them to
every hunter when I was revising the game.

You can find them all [in the Monster of the Week files section](/files/special_moves.pdf).
