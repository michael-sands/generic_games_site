I'm involved with [kiwirpg.com](https://www.kiwirpg.com/): a bunch of RPG designers and actual play creators who are working together to build a hub for folks to find out about what's happening in Aotearoa/New Zealand at the moment. Have an explore!

We're also doing a [bunch of stuff next week](https://www.kiwirpg.com/info/) to get the word out about this whole project. Keep an eye on that for what's going on (including game bundles on drivethruRPG and itch.io, and a bunch of streaming games).
