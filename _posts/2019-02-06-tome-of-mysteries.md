Keepers & hunters! It is rumour no more... The Tome of Mysteries has been found and you will be able to acquire your own copy of these ancient secrets in May. 

* 29 ready to go mysteries with a huge range of monsters (and authors).
* 4 new hunters. The Gumshoe: a hard-boiled PI aware of the unnatural. The Hex: a magician who heedlessly uses dark powers. The Pararomantic: a hunter in love with a monster, which is both helpful and difficult. The Searcher: an eternal student of weirdness, looking for answers.
* New Alternative Weird moves, in case Use Magic isn't enough.
* Weird Phenomenon mysteries, with a puzzle to solve instead of a monster to defeat.
* Special moves for all hunters, triggering when they use their Luck.
* Advice from experienced Keepers on a range of topics, including running con games, improvising a mystery on the fly, making your games more gothic, mining pop culture for your mysteries, and more.
