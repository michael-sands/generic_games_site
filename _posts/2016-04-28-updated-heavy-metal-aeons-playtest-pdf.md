_Heavy Metal Æons_ has now reached "first draft complete" status and the draft is
now with the editor. I've put together a
[new playtest pdf](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5pV27F3R0veOFRZVm1MX21EamM)
for anyone interested to check out and try.

As the game is intended for quick one-shot play, it includes five ready to go
scenarios, each with its own style and world, and I've included Juan Ochoa's
awesome illustrations for each of them to help get you and your group into the
right zone when you play.
