Allies in _Monster of the Week_ can cause some confusion. What can they do? What should they do?

This [Ally Moves mini-supplement](/files/ally_moves_v0_1_2022_05_23.pdf) is an attempt to answer that for Keepers. It has a list of moves that allies can bring to bear on a mystery, when the hunters need their help. 

This is just a first take on it, so if you try it out, let me know how it goes.
