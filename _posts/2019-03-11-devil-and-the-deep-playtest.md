I've just finished up a playtest draft of my Napoleonic naval adventure rpg. _Devil & the Deep_. Please take a look if you are also a fan of Patrick O'Brian, C S Forester, etc.

The game is intended to create character-focused stories about coping with the very dangerous and authoritarian lifestyle of Royal Navy sailors in the years around 1800.

It's in three documents: rules, blank play sheets, and a set of pre-filled play sheets for the quickstart scenario.

Please drop me a line if you read or play it, I'm very keen to get some feedback.
