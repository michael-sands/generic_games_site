There's a [new playtest draft of _Heavy Metal Eons_](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5pV27F3R0vedzhwU3kyMDNpdUk)
available.

It now includes Juan Ochoa's illustrations for all the hero archetypes (of which
there are a few new ones), and updated systems (especially the fight system).

It's still pretty raw and untested, but should be ready for a spin. If you'd
rather wait for something more polished, there should be a new version in the
next two or three weeks after I've had a chance to playtest it more (the next
is scheduled for Monday).

Playtest warnings:

- Foe stats are not well tested and might be too feeble or too tough.

- The initiative system description is very new and might be confusing.

- In the "Going Out With Glory" section, on hero death, the rules are all for
the previous iteration. It should now say:

  "You immediately take the next combat action. Nobody may spend Energy to go
  first. If you attack, your attack is automatically double-amped, and you may
  use other abilities that normally cost Energy or Power for free."
