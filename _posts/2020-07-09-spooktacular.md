Roll up, roll up! The Spooktacular has arrived!

A new Monster of the Week hunter playbook, they're a veteran of a traveling carnival that has a bit of magic to it. Good at dealing with people (especially when "dealing with" means "getting one over on") and they have some mystical abilities relating to fate and illusion.

If that sounds like fun, you can get it from [my itch.io store](https://genericgames.itch.io/the-spooktacular) or [drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/319973/The-Spooktacular).

I've made some community copies avilable on itch.io too, in case there's anyone who wants a copy can't afford the cash right now.
