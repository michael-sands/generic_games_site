There's two big things coming for _Monster of the Week_ next month. 

First, the long-expected _Codex of Worlds_ crowdfunding is nearly here. It's due to start on 15 February. You can [sign up to be emailed when it goes live](https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/83fb2df1-487f-4a3b-b5e0-19b084214e52/landing).

Second, we needed a new reprint of the main book and decided to make it a nice hardcover edition. That's [available for pre-order from Evil Hat Productions](https://evilhat.com/product/monster-of-the-week-hardcover/), releasing on 27 February. There's no new material beyond some new art (most notably that wonderful new cover from Juan Ochoa), but we've included some of the optional rules from _Tome of Mysteries_ for convenience, and two hunter playbooks that were previously available separately (the Snoop and Spooktacular).
