_Heavy Metal Aeons_ just got a big update.

It's still in *early access* and I expect to revise again before I consider it done, but it's had a bunch of things tweaked and streamlined, and I've added some more quests:
* Chronostorm!
* Spears Against the Ice Mother
* Mutant Wasteland
* Dragon Planet

You can [get it at itch.io](https://genericgames.itch.io/heavy-metal-aeons) or [drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/350506/Heavy-Metal-Aeons). There's some community copies available at itch.io in case you would like to try it but can't afford the price at the moment.

I'm still keen to hear any feedback, especially if you play and can let me know how the heroes do against the foes.
