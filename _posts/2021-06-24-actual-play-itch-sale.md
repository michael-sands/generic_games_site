Two updates today.

Number One: I was invited to join the Roll Players actual play podcast for a guest episode, and we played some Heavy Metal Aeons. See how they coped with the [Time God's Chronostorm!](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5JrEbGI5Djks1Obh91UUxV) I'm also working on the next early access release of Heavy Metal Aeons, with a focus on streamlining play and tweaking the balance some more. 

Number Two: [All my stuff is on sale](https://itch.io/s/51226/itchio-summer-sale-2021) over at itch.io as part of their summer sale.
