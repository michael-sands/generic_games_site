Just some before the end of the year announcements for you.

## 1. Itch.io Winter Sale

As of tomorrow, [all my stuff is part of the winter sale](https://itch.io/s/84023/itchio-winter-sale). Buy games for less money, if you want!

## 2. Social Media Apocalypse

Given the current death spiral happening on Twitter, I'm rearranging my methods for getting information out to you. 

If you're on Mastodon, you can follow my account there: [@GenericGamesNZ@dice.camp](https://dice.camp/@GenericGamesNZ)

I've also set up a Substack newsletter, where I'll post information about ongoing projects, releases, and some other thoughts and opinions every few months. Check out [my welcome post](https://genericgamesnz.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-generic-games-newsletter) and subscribe if you like the sound of it.

I also watch the [Monster of the Week subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/monsteroftheweek/), which is a nice community and worth checking out.

I've not quite abandoned Twitter completely, but I'm not on there regularly any more. Other contact details on the footer of this page are also still available.

## 3. Codex of Worlds Status

This is currently in the middle of finalising the text (last round of proof-reading, index building, etc) and we're getting started on the art. This book should look amazing (for reasons I'm not revealing just yet).
