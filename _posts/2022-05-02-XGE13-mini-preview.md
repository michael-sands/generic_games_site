I have a (small) new game release for #kiwiRPG week! Let me introduce _Xenogate Expedition 13 Mini Preview edition_.

_XGE13_ is a full-sized game in development, and recently as an exercise I created a stripped down two-page version. The little game worked, so I'm releasing it as a taster for what's coming. I even added a third page of rules (including a starter mission).

Here's what's going on.

You had a simple mission: travel through the newly activated xenogate and explore another planet. Previous missions have found amazing new discoveries. Who knows what new science you'll find?

But when you stepped through the gate, something went wrong. You can't get back home, and you're stuck on this unknown planet without support.

Now it's time to explore, build a base, and figure out how to get home. 

Maybe you'll be the first expedition to find an alien civilisation? 

Or the secrets of the Gate-makers?

Prepare to step through the Xenogate again...

Contains:

* A stripped down 3-page rulebook (based on the **Forged in the Dark** system).
* Tracking sheets for your expedition, staff, and the imperial adversaries you'll be facing.

You'll need to fill in some details. Knowledge of **Forged in the Dark** game rules (Blades in the Dark and its descendents) will be a help.

You can get it now as pay-what-you-want on [itch.io](https://genericgames.itch.io/xge13-mini-preview-edition) or [drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/394747/XGE13-Mini-Preview-Edition).
