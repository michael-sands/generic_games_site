This is just a notice to let you all know that I'm removing the process to get the "approved by Generic Games" logo on third party works. 

The reason is that it's quite time consuming to work through the changes that I ask for the approved works, and I don't think it's really worth the effort for any of the creators involved or for myself. It also makes me work as a gatekeeper, which I don't want.

I've updated my [third party policy](/third_party_policy) to remove this element. 

If you want to make some works compatible with Monster of the Week (or any of my other games), you can still do so as long as you stay within the third party policy. 

Lastly, existing users of the approved logo may continue to include it in those works, and I am still happy to recommend those products.
