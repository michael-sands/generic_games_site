Now, I should be revising _Heavy Metal Ã†ons_, but I've been procrastinating. That
turns out to be good for the _Monster of the Week_ fans. I've long thought about
how to make the game work a little better for the style where the hunters are
investigating weirdness that isn't necessarily due to a monster (_The X-Files_,
_Fringe_, and the like).

Today I put together an experimental document with how I think it needs to work.
Fair warning: this is all un-tested (beyond my experience of playing one or two
games of _MotW_, anyhow). I'd love to hear how it goes if you give it a try.

You can find it [in the _Monster of the Week_ files section](/files/MotW_more_weirdness.pdf).
