Not every playbook in _Monster of the Week_ got any vehicle or transport options in their gear, but sometimes folks may want some anyway: to fit the team concept, or the game setting, or whatever. 

The [Transportation mini-supplement](/files/transportation_options_v0_2_2022_06_01.pdf) provides transportation lists for all the official playbooks who didn't get any. 

Have fun driving/riding/scootering around!
