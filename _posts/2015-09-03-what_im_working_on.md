I am currently working on a game inspired by heavy metal songs, especially from
the micro-genre of "stoner metal", which I've been listening to a lot of recently.
There's a [playtest draft available](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5pV27F3R0veOFRZVm1MX21EamM),
but the next one will be a major revision of the system. That's still good for
getting an idea about the style of the game, and you can play it and have fun.
The next version should be quite a lot *more* fun, but it's probably a week or
two away.

After that I want to get back on my white whale game, _Devil & the Deep_, based
on age-of-sail naval adventure novels (Patrick O'Brian, C S Forester, Alexander
Kent, etcetera).

Also in the pile are:

* _Three Dooms_: dawn of civilisation, see if you can make your community thrive.
  Rather heavily inspired by [_The Quiet Year_](http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year/).
  Originally a very different game chef entry.

* _The Worlds Above & Below_: Roleplaying as yourself drawn into a fantasy world.
  Also originally a game chef entry.

* I have an almost ready _Monster of the Week_ scenario: Zombiefest 1 & 2. If you
  backed my original campaign back in 2011 you will have seen the first one. I've
  slightly revised that and added a sequel.

* Vague thoughts of a _Monster of the Week_ setting book, either focused on bronze
  and iron age monster hunters, or possibly that and one or two other settings as
  well.

So, plenty happening but mainly quite slowly - mainly as it's been a bit hard to find
time to arrange playtesting this year. In any case, stuff is happening!

Oh, and if you want some less formal updates, consider following my [RPGs
collection on G+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/MYTCX). That gets my
play reports, reshared cool stuff, etc.
