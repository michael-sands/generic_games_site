I've just released into early access my latest game, _The Natural Philosophers_.

This is a non-violent, creative game in which you will imagine what an expedition of natural philosophers discover in an entirely new world. 

You'll fill up a notebook with observations, inspired by a range of random tables, to build the world you explore.

You'll need this PDF, some pens and notebooks, and a few regular six sided dice. There's no game master role, everyone takes an equal part in playing. 

You can get it on [itch](https://genericgames.itch.io/the-natural-philosophers) or [drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/297914/The-Natural-Philosophers).

What "early access" means here is that the game is mostly done, but I still have more development work I intend to put in. If you get a copy now, you'll get access to updates any time I revise it or add more. I'd also appreciate any feedback you have.
