_Heavy Metal Aeons_ is now available! 

It's an *early access release*: ready to play but still needs balancing and tweaks on the challenge level. I'll update it as I playtest more and get feedback, and purchasers will get all those updates and ultimately the finished version.

You can [get it at itch.io](https://genericgames.itch.io/heavy-metal-aeons) or [drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/350506/Heavy-Metal-Aeons). 

I've also put the [hero playsheets up in the files section](/files/Heavy-Metal-Aeons-hero-playsheets.zip), they're a good preview if you want to check out the style of the game.

I'd really appreciate any feedback if you get it, especially if you play and can let me know how the heroes do against the foes.
