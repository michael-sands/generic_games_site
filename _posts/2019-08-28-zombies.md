Are your hunters missing out on their daily recommended number of flesh eating zombies? You can fix that with the _Zombiefest Double Feature_!

Now available at [itch](https://genericgames.itch.io/zombiefest-double-feature) or [drivethruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/287048/Zombiefest-Double-Feature).

In Zombiefest, the Golgotha metal festival gets attacked by flesh-eating zombies and only your hunters will be able to save the day.

In Zombiefest 2, a subsequent Golgotha festival is attacked again. Can your hunters use what they learned to save the festival again?
